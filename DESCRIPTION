Description: To maintain confidentiality, national statistical agencies traditionally do not include
 small counts in publicly released tabular data products. They typically delete these
 small counts, or combine them with counts in adjacent table cells to preserve the totals
 at higher levels of aggregation.  In some cases these suppression procedures result in
 too much loss of information. To increase data utility and make more data publicly
 available, Hawala et. al. created methods and software (in C++) to generate
 synthetic values for the small counts from a Bayesian hierarchical model.  The software
 generates synthetic data and computes several measures of disclosure risk, and was
 applied by the Census Bureau in synthesizing small county-to-county migration counts.
 This package provides an R-interface for implementing the code.
 The original source C++ model is left unchanged aside from minor additions for R-compatibility. All inputs
 and outputs from the model are R objects, as described in the documentation for [link here].

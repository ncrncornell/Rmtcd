# Synthesizing Truncated Count Data for Confidentiality (Rmtcd)

`mtcd`  is a standalone  C++ implementation of the statistical model proposed in "Synthesizing Truncated Count Data for Confidentiality" ([Github copy](https://github.com/labordynamicsinstitute/flow-synthesis/blob/master/doc/NTTS2013Paper123.pdf)).  

This repository contains a R wrapper around the original source code, with minor generalizations.

## Installation

In R, run the following command:

```R
library(devtools)
install_github(“ncrncornell/Rmtcd”)
```
then run
```R
library(SyntheticData)
```
and you can call `getSyntheticData()` function .

If `library(devtools)` doesn’t work, you’ll need to install  the library:

```R
install.packages(“devtools”)
```

On Linux, a frequent error is failure of the `install_github()` function. Workaround (and more generic) is
```R
install_git("https://github.com/ncrncornell/Rmtcd")
```
That always works.
